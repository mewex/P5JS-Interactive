# P5JS-Interactive
README for Advanced p5.js Assignments Repository
Overview
This repository contains a collection of advanced p5.js assignments, each designed to enhance understanding and skills in creating dynamic, interactive visual compositions and animations using p5.js. These assignments focus on more complex concepts like vertex manipulation, function creation, and class usage in p5.js.

Assignments List
A2-01: Create a composition with five or more vertices using beginShape() and endShape().
A2-02: Create a composition with ten or more vertices using beginShape() and endShape().
A2-03: Create an image different from A2-02, but using the same vertex data.
A2-04: Write a function with one parameter and demonstrate it visually.
A2-05: Write a function for drawing triangles and visually demonstrate its flexibility.
A2-06: Write a function with three or more parameters and visually demonstrate its flexibility.
A2-07: Create a dynamic animation using the cos() function as a generator for motion.
A2-08: Create a dynamic animation using the cos() and sin() functions as generators for motion.
A2-09: Move two visual elements across the screen using the random() function for unique nonlinear motion.
A2-10: Create an event that begins when the mouse is pressed and ends when the mouse is released.
A2-11: Create a responsive image that behaves differently when the mouse is moving and dragging.
A2-12: Create a button that changes the background color when clicked.
A2-13: Program moving elements from A2-09 using classes to represent the two visual elements.
A2-14: Make two modifications to the "Particle" class from the example in the slides to alter the particles' appearance/behavior. Include comments to explain the modifications and the entire working example.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
Open in p5.js Web Editor:
Copy the contents of each file into the p5.js web editor to view and interact with the visual outputs.

Usage
Each file in this repository is named according to its corresponding assignment number, e.g., A2-01, A2-02, etc. Open each file to view the source code. Run it in the p5.js environment to see the visual outcomes and understand the programming concepts applied.

Contributions
Contributions to improve the code or add new examples are welcome, provided they maintain the educational focus of the assignments. Ensure all contributions are original and properly documented.
